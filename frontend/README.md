# Getting Started

This is a React project that needs:
- npm
- a backend api to serve data
- an .env file that points to the backend (there is a .env.example file in repo, use it)

# Init

```
npm install
```
then
```
npm run start
```

_Ps.: some elements possibly will not present any meanful information without a link to the server, although this requirement will not crash the aplication._
